            Los Cabos, located in Mexico, was the first time I got to whale watch with
            my family, I saw the Arch of Cabo San Lucas, and ate a lot of seafood.
            During my stay, I saw a lot of animals like turtles, seals, dolphins, and 
            stingrays and also enjoyed the beach.

            People might not know that back home my family and I have a small pond 
            with Japenese goldfish and black moors which have reproduced almost 
            every summer for about 9 years now. They have survived 3 different
            movings and have not bought any more since they started reproducing.
